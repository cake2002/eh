command 1 ) nmap : "nmap"
Stands for "Network Mapper"
it is an open source linux tool for network and security auditing
this tool helps network administrators to reveal hosts and services on various systems
Namp is referred as "Swiss Army Knife"


Working :
Nmap works locally and remotely
uses : scanning for open ports , discovering vulnerabilities, network mapping and maintenance.


____________________________________

TCP flags:

In TCP Connections , TCP flags are used to indicate that a particular state of connection or to provide some additional useful information like 
trouble shooting purpose or to handle a control of particular connection.

Command 2) nmap -help : to display all the commands.



SYN Scan command:  (usually performed on ports)

command : nmap - p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org

uses: invokes the establishment of a half connection with destined target website.
syn scanning does not invovle full conn.
and thus called "half-open scanning technique".


________________________________________


Ack scan 

command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org

-p stands for port no.

-T4 stands for Time mechanism using time mechanism such as -T1 -T2 -T3 -T4 we can more aggresively run the scan.


uses: it never determines open ports, ack scan is enabled by specifying the -sA option.

_____________________________________________________________________

FIN Scan 

command : nmap -sF -T4 scanme.org

states whether the attacker sends a packet with only fin flag enabled.

If the target doesnt responds then it means port is open

if the target responds then the port on target is closed.

___________________________________________________


Null scan (-sN)

command: nmap -sN -p22 scanme.org

will send a tcp segment with no flags in the packet header.

if a port is open then will get the response 
if no flag are set then the target will not know how to handle the  request.
if the port  is closed then the target will send a packet in response.

Xmas 

command: nmap -sX -T4 www.gmail.com

clears the syn bit and thus fly right into through the firewall and packet filtering routers.

this scan doesnt work with agaisnt most Unix-based systems.
